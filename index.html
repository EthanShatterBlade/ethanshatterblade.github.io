        <h2>Kepler 442 B</h2>
        <p>Kepler 442 B is, hands down, the best planet in the Kepler 442 system. It's also the only planet in that system. It's the perfect place for a vacation*, with absolutely no humans to disturb you from your peaceful naps, and no humans to hog the beautiful beaches.<br><br>Kepler 442 B is the perfect place to get away from the monotony of life on Earth. Get away from crazy neighbors, demanding teachers, and your annoying siblings! Take a ride on a spaceship and go to Kepler 442 B today!</p><h6>*Aside from the 4 million year journey</h6>
        <h2>Suitable For Life?</h2>
        <p>Definitely. This exoplanet exceeds even Earth itself in inhabitabliity. Using the criteria outlined in the <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.08922v1.pdf">Comparative Habitability of Transiting Exoplanets</a>, Kepler 442 B scores a 0.836, while Earth only gets a 0.829, slightly less than Kepler 442 B. This ranking system mainly relies on the Goldilocks Zone - a zone where the temperature is just right for liquid water. Therefore, this planet could be even better for life to thrive than Earth is, despite it being much closer to the sun, where it is more vulnerable to solar flares.<br><br>This planet is the perfect place for Earthlings to flock to, should there be a need to. And with overcrowding, climate change, and nuclear wars imminent, now seems a perfect time for planning an escape.</p>
