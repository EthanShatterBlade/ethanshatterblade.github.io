        <h2>System</h2>
        <p>Kepler 422 B orbits around the star Kepler 442 (A+ for creativity, scientists!). However, Kepler 442 B is the only known planet to orbit that star. The star is too dim to see with the naked eye (from Earth), and is part of the Lyra constallation. It is a K-type main sequence star, also known as an orange dwarf. This is slightly cooler than our sun, which is a G-type main sequence star, also known as an orange dwarf.</p>
